                <h1>Outside the Greenhouse</h1>
                <p>This is what the exterior of the Greenhouse looks like. As it can be seen, the "Greenhouse" is 
                  the literal green house fitted with translucent panels that allows light to come in and heat to stay in. There 
                  is a smaller green house on the left which is the stroage shed that will hold any tools and equipment that is needed. 
                  The solar panel is what is currently powering the Greenhouse.

                <h1>Inside the Greenhouse</h1>
                <p>As shown in the above image, the interior of the Greenhouse needs a lot more work to become
                  operational. The interior needs to be cleared out of the miscellaneous objects that are currently
                  being stored, as well as fitted with sensors and actuators in order to collect data about the 
                  Greenhouse. The ones tasked with completing this task will be the students of ECE 597, some of which
                  are present in the above image.

                <p>There are fourteen enclosures that are currently present just ouside the Greenhouse. Some of these enclosures 
                  currently hold some plants, but they are still under construction and will eventually be fitted with a wider 
                  variety of plant life. This location is also where the water irrigation system will be implemented, not only to be
                  able to water the plants, but to also make sure there isn't flooding when it rains.

                <h1>Water Barrels</h1>
                <p>These water barrels are going to be used by the water irrigation team in order to store water and be able
                  to pump water into the Greenhouse. The water that is pumped in will then be used to water all of the plants 
                  within the Greenhouse.
